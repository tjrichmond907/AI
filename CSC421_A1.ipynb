    "1. Agents (Basic) - Modify the BlindDog agent to sleep after eating (reflex agent->model-based agent) \n",
    "2. Agents (Expected) - Change the Environment from a simple 1D environment to a graph-based map environment \n",
    "3. Search (Basic) - Input Australia map, run BFS and DFS \n",
    "4. Search (Basic) - Print Frontier after each expansion \n",
    "5. Search (Expected) RandomSwitch search \n",
    "6. Search (Expected) Random generation + measurement \n",
    "7. Search (Advanced) Plotting \n",
    "8. CSP (Basic): Make example of job scheduling (or some other problem) and run CSP to find solution \n",
    "9. CSP (Expected): Translate complex contraint (maybe alldiff or binary <) to set of binary contraints \n",
    "10. CSP (Advanced): Implement CSP as a search problem and compare DFS with the CSP solver provided  \n",

The current implementation of the Blind Dog checks each square to see if it perceives food. If it perceives food it eats it otherwise it moves down. Notice that currently the HungryDog program maintains a very simple model of the agent (whether it is hungry or not) but does not use that information in any way. Change the implementations provided above so that a new action \"move up\" action is supported by the Park Environment and Blind Dog. Then modify the HungryProgram so that when the dogs is not hungry it moves up instead of down. After it moves up after eating food then it becomes hungry again and returns to the original behavior of moving down when there is no food and eating when there is food. \n",
